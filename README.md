# LAFE
**Lafe is an Artificial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML) chatterbot GUI**. Lafe is a fork of PascAlice (Delphi) with some enhancement added. It is "ported" from Delphi to Lazarus IDE. Currently in early stage of development. This is an old and unmaintained project created since 2011 (originally at Google Code - https://code.google.com/archive/p/lafe/)

# What is AIML?
According to Wikipedia, AIML, or Artificial Intelligence Markup Language, is an XML dialect for creating natural language software agents. The XML dialect called AIML was developed by **Richard Wallace** and a worldwide free software community between 1995 and 2002. AIML formed the basis for what was initially a highly extended Eliza called "A.L.I.C.E.." ("Artificial Linguistic Internet Computer Entity"), which won the annual Loebner Prize Competition in Artificial Intelligence three times, and was also the Chatterbox Challenge Champion in 2004.

# Compiling
You need **Freepascal Lazarus IDE** to compile this project. You will also need to find a missing library called **LibXMLParser** (not included in source)
